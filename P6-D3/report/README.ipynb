    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I work in the aerospace industry, and  I am passionate by Aircrafts. I also have always been fascinated by the fierce competition between Boeing and Airbus. I have read many articles about this topic, and a good introduction about it can be found <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing\">here</a> on wikipedia [6]. This competition is lasting for decades and is a very popular subject: one can easily find some interesting video documentaries or books on Amazon as shown below [7], [8]:\n",
    "<img src=\"./AirbusVsBoeing_JNewhouse.jpg\"/><img src=\"./BirdsOfPrey_MLynn.png\"/>\n",
    "So, I have been quite excited when reading the <a href=\"https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002/parts/00213454010/modules/318423863275461/lessons/3184238632239847/concepts/31814787270923\">\"choose your data set\"</a> udacity page [2] to bump into some aeronautical data.<BR>Of course I immediately choose the <a href=\"http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html\">ASA [3]</a>/<a href=\" https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp\">RITA [4]</a> data set which contains information on United State flight delays and performance and took the challenge to enrich it in such a way to be able to cover my favourite subject: \"Airbus vs Boeing\" and their respective aircrafts models.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I want to convey in this exercise is:\n",
    "- the fierce struggle between the two manufacturer achieving the best maturity for their respective aircrafts (**Note:** The aircraft maturity of an aircraft model is the mean at the entire fleet level of the percentage of time where the aircraft is flying, in contrast to AOG: Aircraft On Ground - This is an indicator of a model reliability (the more an aircraft flys, the more it generates revenues). Hence, Flight Delays can have some influence on this indicator).\n",
    "- Another thing I would like to convey is the dramatic increase of the air traffic from 2004 to 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although data preparation was a bit out of scope of this assignment, it was in my case one of the biggest challenge of this project:<BR>\n",
    "- After having downloaded the data, <b>the first difficulty</b> I had to face was that it did not contain any reference to the Aircraft manufacturer or Aircraft model. Happily enough, I noticed a column labelled as \"TailNumber\". The TailNumber is for an Aircraft the equivallent of the license plate for a car. After doing a lot of research on the web, I managed to find some <a href =\" https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/\">downloadable data</a> published by the FAA [5] listing all US Aircrafts tail numbers.<BR>\n",
    "- Then, <b>the second difficulty</b> was that the FAA data was coming in two parts and required some reconciliation and cleaning: On one hand was the list of all tailnumbers (what I called the masterdataframe in below code), and on the other hand was all the manufacturer data and detailed aircraft model (what I called the mfrdataframe in below code):<BR> "

    "## Design\n",
    "I got inspired by the <a href=\"http://dimplejs.org/advanced_examples_viewer.html?id=advanced_bar_labels\"> advanced bar labels</a> from the advanced example of the Dimple.js web site [9].<BR><img src=\"./advanced_examples_bar_labels.svg\"/><BR> I found it very convenient to represent categorical data (in my case Airbus category Vs Boeing category) and to allow some comparison between them. Although bar charts look simple, this one enables to catch a lot of information in a simple glimpse.<BR> What I liked a lot also, was the visual encoding (thanks to color and legend) of each aggregated subcategory contribution within its parent category, along with the labels providing the exact figures: In my opinion, this was the ideal way to represent the importance of **each aircraft model** for a given manufacturer on my data (Number of Delayed flights) in a very **readable** and straightforward way.<BR> Finally, the last feature I appreciated, were the tooltips when hovering over the data.<BR>\n",
    "However, what I missed a little bit from this example, was a bit of animation and a bit of interactivity. This is where I had to put some efforts for the sake of this exercise:<BR>\n",
    "In term of **narrative**, my goal was to show some sort of struggle, with one competitor leading, the other one closely following to recover the situation and eventually exceeding the other one. To represent such struggle I needed to introduce some kind of temporality. \n",
    "- First, I enabled a static comparison between Airbus & Boeing for every single month in a given year. \n",
    "- Then, as I wanted to emphasis on above mentioned scenario, this is where I introduced interactivity & animation: I implemented a dropdown control to let the user change the year with an animated transition. I was expecting that the leadership would change from one year to another."

    "## Feedback\n",
    "#### My wife's feedback\n",
    "The first early design I shown to my wife in order to get some feedback was as follows:<BR><img src=\"./index1.png\"/><BR> I spent a considerable amount of time to introduce the interactive dropdown and forgot a little bit about the basics:\n",
    "- Indeed, she highlighted that, despite the legend showing clearly the aircraft models, the colors between Airbus & Boeing were too similar and did not enable to distinguish clearly between the two of them. Besides, not everybody knows which Aircraft model belongs to which manufacturer. To take into account her feedback, I modified the legend to have shade of greys for Boeing aircrafts and shade of blue for Airbus aircrafts. This brought a lot of clarity and visual consistency to the design and enabled not to get lost during the animated transitions.\n",
    "- Another point she made, was that the chart was simply missing a title. It did not take long to find the \"Airbus Vs Boeing\" punch line, also used a lot in the medias. I also reflected the color choice in this title to make things even clearer.<BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My colleagues's feedback\n",
    "I then proposed my resulting design to a colleague of mine also working in Aerospace industry:<BR><img src=\"./index2.png\"/> She mentioned that comparing raw numbers (here, the amount of delayed flights) from Airbus & Boeing in the US was not very fair (Airbus was systematically showing less delayed flights than Boeing) and was introducing some bias. Actually, Boeing had some monopoly for many years and sold a huge number of aircrafts in the local market without competition. So, even if Airbus is doing good today and produces yearly about the same number of aircrafts, it started clearly as challenger and it was not able to penetrate the US market right from the beginning. This lead to having far more Boeing A/C flying in the US than Airbus ones. To compensate this bias I tried to find some corrective ratio whose value would depend on the year. I found such values from the wikipedia article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing\">\"competition between Airbus and Boeing\"</a>, table \"Commercial airliners still in operation\", column \"Ratio\". This is of course an approximation as figures are global and not specific to the US and values for 2004 and 2005 were not available and have been approximated to the 2006 value. But this enabled to add some kind of interactivity to the chart and brought what I was looking for, namely this idea of struggle, with close competitors fighting each other.<BR><BR>\n",
    "#### My Son's feedback\n",
    "The last feedback I collected was from my son:<BR><img src=\"./index3.png\"/><BR> It was rather laconic but quite useful in the end. He said \"it's good but there is too much bla bla\". This made me realize that rather than going straight to the point with this idea of struggle/competition, the very first text coming with the chart was about citing sources and explaining correction factor. So I decided to move upward the message I wanted to convey in order to have it first, which leaded to the much more meaningful below submission:\n",
    "<img src=\"./IndexFinal.png\"/>\n",
    "#### The 1rst Udacity reviewer feedback\n",
    "The reviewer advised to add some additional legend regarding Airbus & Boeing. He also mentioned to get the corection factor activated by default to make it more simple for a user to get the messages. Then he advised to reduce the leading text details, going straight to the point. Finally, he advised to improve the navigation by year (As per a Dimple.js advanced example shown <a href=\"http://dimplejs.org/advanced_examples_viewer.html?id=advanced_storyboard_control\">here</a>). All those changes have been implemented in the very final submission below and makes the final result very appealing:\n",
